<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Monitoring blood glucose levels is critical for a diabetic patient. To ensure that glycaemic control is obtained, 
there are a range of anti-diabetic treatments which cannot restore the lost functional beta-cell mass but can help 
in the management of glycaemia. These treatments include monitoring of the blood glucose levels via skin mounted 
patches (transdermal applications) and subcutaneous methods such as injecting insulin into a diabetic person, 
meanwhile chemists and engineers alike are investigating other approaches such as oral, nasal and buccal applications. 
Given the evolving nature of diabetes, there is an increase in research of treatments, and a large variety of 
therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Despite the struggle in monitoring diabetes, engineers have proposed many 
ways in which alleviate the “disturbances” that may come with managing diabetes.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction: What is diabetes?</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Diabetes is a metabolic disease defined by elevated blood glucose levels. It is comprised of four types: type 1, type 2, 
pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes, with type 1 and 2 accounting for ~95% of diagnosed forms worldwide. Type 1 diabetes 
involves autoimmune destruction of beta-cells which produce insulin, whereas type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance 
where beta-cells are either lost or impaired. If untreated this can lead to hyperglycaemia (causing cardiovascular and 
neurological complications) or hypoglycaemia (leading to fatigue and possibly premature death).  
<br><br>
The worldwide distribution of diabetes predicted by the WHO suggests ~700 million people affected by 2045 
(<a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/diabetes-rising-worldwide-one-in-11-adults-affected/">Diabetes rising worldwide: 1 in 11 adults affected (2019)</a>).  
Diabetes is becoming one of the leading causes of physical complications and infections, significantly reducing life expectancy.

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<h3 id="monitoring">1. Monitoring diabetes: Cause and prevention</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Blood glucose levels can be monitored via diet, which is a major disturbance influencing glucose levels. 
Diagnosis of diabetes can occur through three clinical methods 
(<a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/test-for-diabetes/">Diabetes Diagnosis & Tests | ADA</a>):
<br><br>
<br>– Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
<br>– Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
<br>– Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) laboratory test 
<br><br>
Type 2 diabetes accounts for ~90% of cases in the UK 
(<a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/test-for-diabetes/">Khan, R. et al. (2019)</a>) and is strongly associated with obesity.  
<br><br>
Studies show that individuals with a BMI higher than 35 have a significantly higher chance of developing T2DM than those 
with a BMI under 22. For Asians, increased risk begins at even lower BMI values (15–20). New research suggests waist 
circumference may be a better predictor of T2DM risk than BMI, and weight loss significantly reduces risk 
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22281657/">Cheung, B.M.Y. & Li, C. (2012)</a>).  
<br><br>
Lifestyle plays a major role; sedentary behaviour (e.g., prolonged TV watching) decreases metabolic rate and increases BMI. 
Replacing 30 minutes of sedentary time with physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity by 15%.  
<br><br>
Men are more frequently diagnosed with diabetes due to differences in fat distribution (more visceral fat). Environmental 
factors such as stress, smoking, alcohol consumption and sleep affect risk as well.  
<br><br>
Hypertension and diabetes commonly overlap, and may share metabolic pathways related to obesity 
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22281657/">Cheung & Li, 2012</a>).
</p>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<h3 id="treating">2. Treating diabetes: drug delivery and development</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Common home monitoring uses glucometers, which require a finger prick blood sample. Environmental factors may influence 
accuracy. Modern alternatives include glucose-sensing patches and insulin pumps that measure glucose in interstitial fluid.  
<br><br>
Buccal applications offer advantages such as avoiding first-pass metabolism, while oral spray forms of insulin provide a 
less invasive method—but are not a full replacement for traditional insulin intake.  
<br><br>
Subcutaneous injections remain the most common method of insulin delivery despite discomfort. Improvements include 
“ultra-rapid acting” insulin which aims to reduce hypoglycaemia risk and improve control of glucose levels.
</p>

<!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Despite being highly prevalent, diabetes can be prevented by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet. Research continues 
to explore more efficient insulin delivery methods that aim to match the effectiveness of subcutaneous injections while 
reducing discomfort. This article provides insight into diabetes, its causes, treatment options and future technological 
advances in drug delivery.
