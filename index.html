<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Monitoring blood glucose levels is critical for a diabetic patient. To ensure that glycaemic control is obtained, there are 
a range of anti-diabetic treatments which cannot restore the lost functional beta-cell mass but can help in the management 
of glycaemia. These treatments include monitoring of the blood glucose levels via skin mounted patches (transdermal applications) 
and subcutaneous methods such as injecting insulin into a diabetic person. Meanwhile, chemists and engineers alike are 
investigating other approaches such as oral, nasal and buccal applications. Given the evolving nature of diabetes, there is 
an increase in research of treatments, and a large variety of therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Despite the struggle 
in monitoring diabetes, engineers have proposed many ways to alleviate the “disturbances” that may come with managing diabetes.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction: What is diabetes?</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Diabetes is a metabolic disease defined by elevated blood glucose levels. It comprises four types: type 1, type 2, 
pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes, with type 1 and 2 accounting for ~95% of diagnosed forms worldwide. Type 1 diabetes 
involves autoimmune destruction of beta-cells which produce insulin, whereas type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance 
where beta-cells are lost or impaired. If untreated, this can result in hyperglycaemia (leading to cardiovascular and 
neurological complications) or hypoglycaemia (leading to fatigue and potentially premature death).

Worldwide distribution data from the WHO predicts ~700 million cases by 2045. Thus, diabetes is soon to become one of the 
largest global health issues. It is also a leading cause of physical complications and infections which significantly lower 
life expectancy for future generations.

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<h3 id="monitoring">1. Monitoring diabetes: Cause and prevention</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Blood glucose levels can vary depending on diet, proving to be a major disturbance in controlling blood glucose levels. 
Diagnosis of diabetes can occur via:  

- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)  
- Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)  
- Glycated haemoglobin levels via a laboratory test  

Type 2 diabetes accounts for ~90% of UK cases and is strongly linked to obesity. Studies show that individuals with higher 
BMI have a greatly increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Risk can be reduced through weight loss and increased 
physical activity.

Gender also plays a role, with men being diagnosed more frequently due to physiological differences such as visceral fat 
distribution. Environmental factors such as sleep, stress and lifestyle also influence risk.  
Diabetes and hypertension often overlap and may share metabolic origins linked to obesity.

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<h3 id="treating">2. Treating diabetes: drug delivery and development</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Common methods for monitoring glucose include glucometers, which require a blood sample from a finger prick. However, 
environmental factors may affect accuracy. Modern glucose-sensing patches and insulin pumps detect glucose in interstitial 
fluid.

Other administration routes include buccal methods (avoiding first-pass metabolism), oral sprays, and nasal delivery.  
Subcutaneous injections remain the most common insulin delivery method despite discomfort. Recent improvements include 
“ultra-rapid acting” insulin designed to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.
</p>

<!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Although diabetes is highly prevalent worldwide, it can be prevented through healthy lifestyle habits and appropriate diet. 
Research continues to improve insulin delivery with the aim of providing methods as effective as subcutaneous injections but 
less painful for the patient. This article aims to provide insight into diabetes, its causes, treatments and how technological 
advances may improve drug delivery in the future.
