 Monitoring blood glucose levels is critical for a diabetic patient.To ensure that glycaemic control is obtained, there are a range of anti-diabetic treatments which cannot restore the lost functional beta-cell mass 
 but can help in the management of glycaemia. These treatments include monitoring of the blood glucose levels via skin mounted patches i.e. transdermal applications and subcutaneous methods such as injecting insulin 
 into a diabetic person, meanwhile chemist and engineers alike are investigating other approaches such as oral, nasal and buccal applications. Given the evolving nature of diabetes, there is an increase in research 
 of treatments, and a large variety of therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Despite the struggle in monitoring diabetes, engineers have proposed many ways in which alleviates the ‘’disturbances’’ that may come 
 with managing diabetes.

Diabetes is a metabolic disease which is defined by the elevated blood glucose level. They are comprised of four types which are as follows: type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes, with type 1 and 2 
accounting for ~95% of the diagnosed forms worldwide. Type 1 diabetes involves the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells which produce insulin whereas type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance where the beta-cells 
are either lost or have impaired function. If untreated this can result to hyperglycaemia in which the body performs cardiovascular and neurological complications and hypoglycaemia where the body experiences fatigue 
and ultimately premature death.

The worldwide distribution of diabetes by the World Health Organisation predicts ~700 million people worldwide would be affected by diabetes by 2045 (Fig.1). Thus, diabetes is soon to be one of the largest public
health issues globally. Overall, diabetes is becoming one of the leading causes of many dire physical complications as well infections which considerably lowers the life expectancy of the future generations to come.
