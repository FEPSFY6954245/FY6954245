       Monitoring blood glucose levels is critical for a diabetic patient.To ensure that glycaemic control is obtained, there are a range of anti-diabetic treatments which cannot restore the lost functional beta-cell mass but can help in the management of glycaemia. These treatments include monitoring of the blood glucose levels via skin mounted patches i.e. transdermal applications and subcutaneous methods such as injecting insulin into a diabetic person, meanwhile chemist and engineers alike are investigating other approaches such as oral, nasal and buccal applications. Given the evolving nature of diabetes, there is an increase in research of treatments, and a large variety of therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Despite the struggle in monitoring diabetes, engineers have proposed many ways in which alleviates the ‘’disturbances’’ that may come with managing diabetes.
